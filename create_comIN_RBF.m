function [comIN_RBF]=create_comIN_RBF(dainputs,epsHist,center_daHist,h_GRBF)
%Function places all for the validation or approximation section. comIN_RBF
%is a 'n'x'p' matrix where 'n' is the number of observations (datapoints) and
%'p' is the number of RBFs.  Each column is the value of the a respective
%RBF at each datapoint location.  comIN_RBF is combined with the algebraic
%term combinations and multiplied by all coefficients (RBF and Algebraic)
%to product the model approximation for each datapoint

%INPUTS:
%  dainputs  = Current Section (voltage - (global zeros) )
%  epsHist  =  History of GRBF epsilon values, as determined from calibration section
%  center_daHist = Voltages of GRBF centers. Dim 1= RBF #, Dim 2= Channel for voltage, Dim 3= Dimension center is placed in ( what load channel it is helping approximate)
%  h  =  h value for GRBFs, as determined by point spacing in calib section

%OUTPUTS:
%  comIN_RBF  =  Input for load approximation, to be multiplied by
%  coefficients with algebraic comIN to determine load value

comIN_RBF=((eps_long.^voltdimFlag)/(sqrt(pi^voltdimFlag))).*exp(-((eps_long.^2).*(R_square))/h_GRBF^2); %From 'Iterated Approximate Moving Least Squares Approximation', Fasshauer and Zhang, Equation 22
