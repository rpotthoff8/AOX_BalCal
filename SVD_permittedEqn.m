% Method uses SVD to determine the "permitted" set of terms for math model
% by enforcing the constraint that no terms (columns of predictor variable matrix)
% are linearly dependant. Mirrors approach used by BalFit to ensure a
% non-singular solution always exists for the global regression problem.
% Basic flow off process:
% 1) Perform 2 term regression (intercept and voltage) for simple voltage to load model
% 2) Use model to calculate gage output capacities from channel load capacities
% 3) Set threshold for "zero" as a percentage of gage capacity. Temporarily set voltages below threshold to zero
% 4) Assemble predictor term matrix with zeroed original voltage outputs
% 5) Start with first column of predictor variables. Use 'rank' command to determine rank with second column added. If full rank, add column to permitted equation. If not, discard column.
% 6) Repeat in order until all columns have been tested. This results in vector of which terms are not linear dependant and can be included in the model without resulting in a near-singlular matrix
% 7) Repeat for other channels as necessary (if custom equation is different between channels)
% See BalFit references 'B13' (pg 3), 'ReferenceGuide-2019' (pg 17, 40),
% 'B2' (pg 3) for explanation of BalFit's approach

%INPUTS:
%  customMatrix = Current matrix of what terms should be included in Eqn Set.
%  customMatrix_req = Minimum terms that must be included in Eqn Set.
%  voltdimFlag = Dimension of voltage data (# channels)
%  loaddimFlag = Dimension of load data (# channels)
%  dainputs0 = Matrix of voltage outputs
%  FLAGS = Structure containing flags for user preferences
%  targetMatrix0 = Matrix of target values (loads)
%  series0 = Series labels for each point
%  voltagelist = Labels for voltage columns
%  zero_threshold = In Balfit: MATH MODEL SELECTION THRESHOLD IN % OF CAPACITY. This variable is used in performing SVD. Datapoints where the gage output (voltage) is less
...then the threshold as a percentage of gage capacity are set to zero for constructing comIN and performing SVD
    %  loadCapacities = Maximum load capacity for each channel
%  nterms = Number of predictor terms in regression model
%  nseries0 = Number of series

%OUTPUTS:
% customMatrix_permitted = New custom Eqn matrix for which terms are supported by the dataset
% FLAGS = Structure containing flags for user preferences
